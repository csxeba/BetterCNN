 * Artificial Neural Network implementation for roadsign classification.
 * Various layer definitions can be found in the layerdefs directory.
 * Concrete network definition is implemented as a class with layer objects
 * as members. I didn't create it to be flexible.
 * Since the use of 3db party libs was not allowed, I wrote my own matrix
 * operations, which can be found in the utility/matops files. They are not
 * fast, I didn't paralellize them.
 * I tried to be as elegant as possible, but I'm no C++ programmer, and most
 * of my time and energy was spent learning the tits and tats of the language.
 * This was a fun project though. Real challange.
 * 3-4 hours of learning ahead with this one...
